# electrooptic-response-function

Here one can find all scripts used in my report about electrooptic response function. 

There are four files avaliable, with different approaches. [This script](../master/EOS_response_function.ipynb) is the most important one, as it includes complete calculation.

The effect of THz spatiotemporal transformation will be included later.
